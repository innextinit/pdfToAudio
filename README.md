## My thinking

Omo, I know I'm lazy, very lazy when it comes to reading but to make it, person need read oo

I dont know how I will start this project, I just know I need it to function.

## Direction

The route I will most likely take is

- convert my pdf to txt - I dont like the way speechify made the whole pdf text into one big one, so I will most like do page by page to text.
- convert my text to audio, which I think Google Text to Speech would do
- then a one page frontend, where I can upload pdf and download the audio or listen

## Technologys

I cant say this and this, but as I get clearity on what to use would update this from time to time but lets list the possible ones first

- I have not used [TypeScript - TS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) before and I want to learn so this would be a good place to use it

- If I need to use a database, am using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

- Build API with NodeJS and ExpressJS framework
